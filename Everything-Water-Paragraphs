Water. Something so essential, it is the first thing sought out when discovering new planets. But despite being so integral to life, it is one of the most wasted natural resources. Our app, Everything Water, not only helps people with getting the right amount of water for a healthy lifestyle but also helps them become more aware of how much water they use â€“ allowing them to reflect on their daily practices that could be changed to reduce their wastage. Focusing on the first aspect of our app, Everything Water helps society with something that is so easily forgotten: staying hydrated. Not being adequately hydrated often leads to worse conditions such as fatigue, hunger, and pain. Everything Water aims to reduce these afflictions to the human body by setting a reasonable goal for a person based on their unique physical attributes. 

Beyond individual health, Everything Water seeks to reduce the environmental impact water wastage has one person at a time. Based on metrics from the NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council), inadequate water kills more people than war and all other forms of violence combined. Misusing the privilege of water leads to an unnecessary amount of it ending up as untreated and polluted water that can kill a person. Everything Water works at an individual level to help individuals bring reform to their water usage habits, eventually gathering enough dedicated users to make a significant dent in the current water wastage data.
